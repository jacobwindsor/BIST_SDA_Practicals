# Practical 1
## Ex. 1
Run `inferenceandparameter.py` and see output for test statistics

## Ex. 2
Run `binomial.py` and see output for test statistics. Multiple tests are run for each column in the spider_web data.

In this case, increasing number of samples increases the likelihood that CLT holds.

## Ex. 3
Run `uniform.py` and see output for test statistics.

In this case, CLT always holds
