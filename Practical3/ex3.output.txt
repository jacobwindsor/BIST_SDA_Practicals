Correlation between residuals: (-0.5273750528566099, 0.00674732634080353)
The above value indicates the partial correlation between the effect of longevity on size and the effect of egg_rate on size.
Given that the p value is two tailed. The p value for the lower tail is large so there is a low probability that the two are negatively partially correlated. However, there is a high probability that they are positively partially correlated.
